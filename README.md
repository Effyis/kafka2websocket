**Apache Kafka to WebSocket** creates web-socket server that serves data from Apache Kafka topic(s). This is also great tool for inspecting Kafka topic(s) using built-in browser based consumer.

## How to use
* create your `config.yaml` file, you can call `k2ws -init` to begin with
* download and run [binary](https://github.com/Effyis/kafka2websocket/releases) for your OS (`config.yaml` should be in the same directory)

### Simple setup
![Simple K2WS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Effyis/kafka2websocket/master/docs/imgs/k2ws-simple.png)

```yaml
schema.version: "1.0"
kafka.to.websocket:
  - kafka.consumer.config:
      metadata.broker.list: kafka:9092
      group.id: k2ws-group
    kafka.topics:
      - test
    address: :80
```

```

### Kafka config options
For setting up `kafka.consumer.config` and `kafka.default.topic.config ` refer to [librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/dbde254bf7671d5b106ebc70de25ee92cd5fe6a7/CONFIGURATION.md) docs.

Property                                |Required | Range           |       Default | Description              
----------------------------------------|:-------:|-----------------|--------------:|--------------------------
`kafka.consumer.config/metadata.broker.list` |   yes   |                 |               | Initial list of brokers as a CSV list of broker host or host:port.
`kafka.consumer.config/group.id`             |         |                 |               | Client group id string. All clients sharing the same group.id belong to the same group. If omitted group id will be expected to be passed by client.
`kafka.default.topic.config/auto.offset.reset` |         | smallest, earliest, beginning, largest, latest, end, error |  | Action to take when there is no initial offset in offset store or the desired offset is out of range. If omitted it will be expected to be passed by client. 
`kafka.topics`                                |         |                 |               | List of Kafka topics that will be served via websocket. If omitted topic list will be expected to be passed by client.
`address`                               |   yes   |                 |               | Host (or IP) and port pair where socket will be served from. Host (IP) is optional. Example `localhost:8888` or `:8888`.
`endpoint.prefix`                       |         |                 |               | Prefix of the websocket and test paths. By default is empty.
`endpoint.websocket`                    |         |                 |               | Path to websocket URL. By default it's empty.
`endpoint.test`                         |         |                 |          test | Path to test page URL.
`message.details`                       |         |                 |       `false` | Include key, headers, topic partition, timestamp into websocket message payload. Message will be in JSON format. Field `value` will hold the original message, whose representation depends on `message.type` property.
`message.type`                          |         | json, text, binary |          json | Type of Kafka messages. This is only important when `message.details` option is set to `true` because it will affect creation of websocket message payload. `binary` messages will be encoded into base64 string, `text` into JSON string and `json` will keep original form.

When `topics`, `kafka.consumer.config/group.id` and/or `kafka.consumer.config/auto.offset.reset` are omitted in configuration, they are expected to be set by client as a query parameters in websocket URL. For example if websocket URL is `ws://localhost:8888/` client can set these by making request to `ws://localhost:8888/?topics=topicA,topicB&group.id=mygroup&auto.offset.reset=earliest`. Note that this only works for parameters that are omitted from configuration thus setting them otherwise will have no effect.

You can serve more then one Kafka config entry on the same port as long as they all have unique websocket and test endpoints.

### Test page
Every `kafka.to.websocket` entry will have it's own test page. By default this page will be accessible on `/test` path or on `endpoint.test` path if `endpoint.test` is defined in entry's configuration.

Test page can open up websocket and start consuming Kafka topic(s). It will display message for 1 second by default and then it will display another message that came at the current time, meaning that some messages will not be shown when message rate is high (higher then 1 message per second). Even though messages are not displayed, they will still be consumed and processed by the page. Test page has handy filtering capability that makes it possible to execute small JavaScript code for each message in which you can decide what you want to do with the message and want you want to display.

![K2WS test page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Effyis/kafka2websocket/master/docs/imgs/k2ws-testpage.png)

* `Open` - Opens up websocket connection (kafka topic(s) consumption will start).
* `Close` - Closes websocket connection (kafka topic(s) consumption will stop).
* `Setup` - Toggle button, shows or hides connection setup options.If any of `topics`, `group.id` or `auto.offset.reset` are omitted from configuration entry, client will have to set them up here before opening websocket connection.
* `Auto-close` - Defines how many messages test page should receive before it automatically closes up websocket connection.
* `Stack` - Toggle button, when active it will make test page stack incoming messages into JSON array.
* `Record` - Toggle button, when active it will start recording messages and save them to a file once button is deactivated or if size exceeds 200MB
* `5511 / 9mps` - Shows total number of received messages and current message consumption rate, it will reset when it's clicked.
* `1 sec` - Configures how long should a message be displayed.
* `Filter` - Toggle button, when active it will show filter editor where you can configure JavaScript code to execute for each message.
* `Freeze` - Toggle button, when active it will freeze current message, consumption will still run in the background.
* `Evaluate` - It will evaluate current JavaScript filter code on the latest message (or froze message if freeze is active). Only shows up when filter is active.

Incoming (or filtered) messages are displayed on the bottom left text area. Filter editor is displayed on the bottom right when filtering is activated.

## Updating static HTTP files
Add/remove/modify files in `k2ws/static` directory and using [esc](https://github.com/mjibson/esc) tool from inside `k2ws` directory run `esc -o static.go static`. This will re-create `static.go`. 

## Build

**This project has [`librdkafka`](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka) dependency.**

You can build it statically with `go build -tags static`. Check out [confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go#static-builds) for more info.

### Build with Docker (Linux)
```sh
docker build -f Dockerfile.build -t k2ws-build .
docker run --rm -v $PWD/build:/build k2ws-build
```

You'll end up with `./build/k2ws` executable that works on Linux.

### Build and run with Docker
**Build**
```sh
docker build -f Dockerfile.k2ws -t k2ws .
```

**Run**
```sh
docker run -d --name=k2ws --net=host -v _PATH_TO_CONFIG_:/config.yaml k2ws
```

### Build for Windows
* get and start `cygwin64` installation from https://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe
  * select install from Internet
  * select `C:\cygwin64` as root directory
  * select `muug.ca` domain
  * view -> full
  * install `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc` and `pkg-config`
    * click on the icon left from *Skip* ( keep clicking until you figure the latest version )
  * optionally put `setup-x86_64.exe` in `c:\cygwin64\` for convenience so that you can install more libs later if needed
* add `c:\cygwin64\` to PATH
* open your project directory in command prompt
* get `nuget` from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/latest/nuget.exe
* run `nuget install librdkafka.redist -Version 0.11.4` ( this is currently the latest version )
* this will download `rdkafka` into new `librdkafka.redist.0.11.4` directory
* copy `.\librdkafka.redist.0.11.4\build\native\include\` into `c:\cygwin64\usr\include\`
* copy `.\librdkafka.redist.0.11.4\build\native\lib\win7\x64\win7-x64-Release\v120\librdkafka.lib` into `c:\cygwin64\lib\librdkafka.a` (notice `.lib` is renamed to `.a`)
* create file `rdkafka.pc` in the project's root directory with following content:
```
prefix=c:/
libdir=c:/cygwin64/lib/
includedir=c:/cygwin64/usr/include

Name: librdkafka
Description: The Apache Kafka C/C++ library
Version: 0.11.4
Cflags: -I${includedir}
Libs: -L${libdir} -lrdkafka
Libs.private: -lssl -lcrypto -lcrypto -lz -ldl -lpthread -lrt
```
* run `set CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc` (this will allow `cgo` to use `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc` instead of `gcc` - you can make sure it worked with `go env CC`)
* run `go build`, that will create executable
* deliver `librdkafka.dll`, `msvcr120.dll` and `zlib.dll` from `.\librdkafka.redist.0.11.4\runtimes\win7-x64\native\` alongside with executable
